			So how where these projects created?
		</p>
		<p>
			All projects are made in 4 steps, some smaller than others.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The first step is to draw a sketch on paper. Some doodling just to get the idea of the concept you're trying to build. With a client involved, this is a perfect way to see if both parties have understood the task ahead.
			</li>
			<li>
				The next step is to convert it into a mockup on the computer. This is often more extensive than the sketching. It is easier to continue the work in Photoshop when having a base of sketches and mockups.
			</li>
			<li>
				The third step is where the magic happens. Here, the sketches and mockups come to life! This step is usually recursive and requires quite a few retakes before it gets right.
			</li>
			<li>
				The fourth and final step is slicing and converting the PSD file from previous step into a website.
			</li>
		</ol>
